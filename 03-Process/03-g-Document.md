# Write the Architecture Document

- A combination of all the efforts you've put into the system, and this is your greatest creation.

- The architecture document describes the whole process you have been through and gives the developers and management a full picture of the system that is going to be built.

- A good architecture document is relevant for all the levels in the organization, the CEO, the CIO, the project manager, and of course the developers; they will all find great value in it.
