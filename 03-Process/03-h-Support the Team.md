# Support the team

- Subtle architecture is a living, breathing creature, and it changes all the time.

- You have to be there for the developers to help them to make sure they're developing according to the architecture and to be part of the dilemmas that are going to be raised.

- And there are going to be a lot of dilemmas, arguments, and talks, and the architecture will be changed and not only once.

- So you have to support the team if you don't want the documents to become a glorified paperweight.

- And remember, you are not done until the system is in production, and even then, you probably will have a lot to do.
