# Non functional Requriments

- Non-functional requirements are a special kind of requirements that define some technical and service level attributes of the system.

- For example, the most common non-functional requirements are about concurrent number of users, heavy loads, volumes of data and performance.

- The client and the system analyst are usually not aware of the non-functional requirements, and it's the architect's job to help them formulate those requirements.

- The non-functional requirements are much more important than the regular requirements.

- Never begin to work on a system before knowing exactly what its non-functional requirements are because so many architectural elements can be affected by those requirements.
