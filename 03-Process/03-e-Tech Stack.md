# Select Tech Stack

- Decide together with the development team what will be the platform on which the system will be based.

- Usually there will be more than one technology to be used.

- In most systems, you will have to select the backend platform, the front end platform and the data store platform.

    - In addition, in some systems such as ones that are based on microservices architecture, you will often select multiple backend platforms and perhaps also multiple data stores.

- There are a lot of factors you have to consider when selecting the technology stack. 
  
- And the selection must be very rational.

- A wrong technology stack can lead to failure of the whole system.
