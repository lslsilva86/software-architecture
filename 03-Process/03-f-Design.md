# Design the Architecture

- This is the heart of your work.

- You already have the 
  - requirements 
  - non-functional requirements, 
  - components 
  - technology stack.

- Left is to design the architecture that will glue all those together and will result in a system that is fast, secure, reliable, and easy to maintain.

- Well-designed system,
    - loose coupling
    - stateless
    - scaling
    - caching
    - messaging
    - etc

- Those qualities are used as the building blocks of the architecture
