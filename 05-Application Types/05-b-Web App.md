# Web apps 

- The most common application type nowadays, second, maybe, only to web API.

- Web apps, also known as websites, are basically the way the Internet worked since its inception.

- With web apps, there is a web server, usually more than one, and a web browser.

- Those two communicate with each other via HTTP protocol although other protocols can also be used.

- The browser sends an HTTP request for the server, asking for a resource.

- The resource, in this case, is an HTML page which gets returned to the browser which in turn renders it for the end user.

- The HTML page will use JavaScript code for implementing logic in the browser and CSS files for the visual design of the page.

- Web apps are best for systems that require user interface for end user, user-initiated actions, meaning the user is the one making the request to do something, such as viewing all their data, saving username and so on.

- Large scale, with a large number of users and a lot of data.

- Short, focused action as opposed to long-running processes.

  - For example, web apps are not a good fit for a process that should crunch billions of numbers and produce business intelligence.

- Web apps work in a request-response model which is perhaps the most important aspect of them.

- As a rule of thumb, if the system you are working on can be described as a request-response application, then you are probably looking at a web app.
