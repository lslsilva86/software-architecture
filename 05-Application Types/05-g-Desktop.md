# Desktop applications 

- In a world where web APIs and clouds are all the rage, almost nobody talks about desktop apps, and for good reason.

- Desktop apps are applications that run mainly on the PC.

- It's important to differentiate it from rich client apps that access web API and are only a thin, visual layer above the data.

- Application that has all its resources, including logic and data, on the local PC.

- This application might be using the internet for some arbitrary task such as validating license or sending activity logs, but it will still be fully functional when offline.

- Another aspect of desktop application is its user interface.

- Desktop apps are targeted for end users, and they will usually have a great user interface. One good example of such an application is Microsoft Word, which works with or without an active internet connection. Of course, you will lose some capability when offline, such - as cloud connectivity, but it is still fully functional this way.

- Due to massive use of cloud computing and the ubiquity of internet connectivity, desktop app's popularity is dwindling.

- You will use desktop apps mainly for 
  - user-centric actions, such as word processing or calculations
  - heavy gaming, but again
