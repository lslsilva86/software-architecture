# backend and service technology

- the service side of Web Apps, Web API, console, and services


## .NET Classic, simply .NET.

- .NET was founded by Microsoft in 2001 as a response for Java.

- It's a general purpose, object-oriented, statically-typed platform with frameworks for desktop applications called Win phones, and later on WPF, and for Web Apps and Web API called ASP.NET.

- Development in .NET is done using Visual Studio. one of the best development tools on the planet.

- .NET is not cross platform, so it's relevant only for Windows-based applications.

- Its performance are okay but there are faster platforms such as Node.js.

- .NET is a very mature platform with huge third party components and large community.

- However, it's roadmap is not clear since it looks like Microsoft is pushing .NET developers towards .NET Core.

- .NET is a default choice for Windows-based application, mainly because of its great IDE, clear syntax, and large community.

## .NET Core - next generation .NET,

- it aims to fill the gaps in .NET, mainly cross-platform support and performance.

- .NET Core is a flexible and fast platform, 

- not fully baked yet. There are some glaring omissions such as webhook support, partial OData support, partial ORM support and more. .NET Core v3.0 is just around the corner, and it has all the features I missed in early versions.

- .NET Core apps can be developed using Visual Studio, but also with VS Code and other popular IDEs do.

- .NET Core community is not that large but is very vocal and is growing rapidly.

- In the last Stack Overflow Developer Survey, it's called second among server side frameworks right after Node.js.

- In the long run, .NET Core would be a great choice. Right now, you should be aware about its gap but also about its amazing performance and capabilities.

## Java

- Java has been around for a long time and looks like it's here to stay.

- Created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, currently owned by Oracle.

- Java is one of the most popular platforms in use today. Like .NET, it's a general purpose, object-oriented statically-typed language.

- It's really forage into client side into the form of Java applets. And later JavaFX was not a huge success but the Android ecosystem with apps written natively in Java gave it a huge boost.

- The server side Java is called Java EE, recently changed to Jakarta Enterprise Edition and provides everything you can expect from a server side platform, including Web Apps, Web API, database access, and lots more, and all this in a cross platform environment.

- Java has a huge community, sometimes suffering from too much self-criticism but still provides great support for everything Java.

- In the last years, it looks like the interest in Java or the backend has waned and new kids in the block get all their attention, but Java is still a great platform for Web Apps and Web API.

## Node.js 

- is one of the youngest platform here, second only to .NET Core.

- It was founded on 2009 by Ryan Dahl and is optimized for highly concurrent Web Apps.

- Its syntax is based on JavaScript which makes it dynamically typed and it quickly gain adoption because of its familial syntax and great performance.

- It's probably one of the fastest frameworks out there fighting with .NET Core on the first place.

- Node.js is not targeted for long running processes so don't try to build services with it. But for Web Apps that require a lot of short, concurrent I/O operations, it should be on the top of the list.

## PHP 

- was founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdof, which makes it even more mature than Java.

- But in contrast to Java, which is object-oriented, statically-typed language, PHP is Messy.

- It's very easy to learn, but that comes at a cost. It sometimes looks like it was rushed out of the gate and was not polished enough.

- However, it's one of the most popular languages out there and has a vibrant community.

- PHP is laser-focused on Web Apps and Web API. So if you are planning a long running component better look somewhere else.

##  Python

- Founded on 1989 by Guido van Rossum and quickly became one of the most popular scripting language,

- Python quickly gained momentum as a language that can perform almost any task.

- You can find it inside applications written in other platforms, in machine learning systems, as a Web App or Web API.

- One of the strongest selling point of Python is its learning curve.

- It is one of the easiest language to learn and is also very tolerant.

- Python also has a large community, which is known for its helpful members.

- You can consider Python for almost any type of application including Web App, Web API, console, or service.
