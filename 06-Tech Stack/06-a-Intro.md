# Technology stack

- selecting the technology stack of the system.

- The selected technology stack will determine what languages, platforms, and tools will be used during system development, and what are the skills required from the development team.

- This decision is

   - irreversible.
      - Once you've decided to use a specific platform and work has begun on this platform, you can't reverse it. It's not possible to decide, three months into development, that actually, we prefer another platform. Such a decision will result in a complete rewrite of the system and a substantial delay in schedule.

      - There are some architectural patterns that allow some kind of flexibility in the technology stack selection, notably microservices, but even there, it's not a good idea to switch platforms between each service.

  - decisions like that are often loaded with emotions and are made on a non-rational basis.
    - You will encounter situations where the development team would like to use a specific platform because it's new, sexy, and the team across the corridor already uses it. It won't matter that this technology is inferior for this specific task in hand. They will still want it. So, this decision has to be made with clear mind, must be heavily documented, and be a group effort, and not only yours, the architect.
