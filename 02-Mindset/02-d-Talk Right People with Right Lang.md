# Watch your language

## Always keep in mind what is the THING that REALLY matters to the person you are talking to

- PM - "This new technology can help us write the code twice as fast, so we can cut our schedule and budget accordingly." This is a language a project manager understands.
  - Not This "This is the latest and greatest pattern, and we'll be the first to test it out. We can write a blog post about it."
- Team Lead - "Listen, Dave, have you heard of the latest angular version We are going to use it." Or, "You know, function as a service are pretty cool. What do you say we'll give it a try in this project?"
- CEO - "The architecture I've designed will ensure the continuity of the business and will be able to cope with the high loads expected during Black Friday sales,"
  - is the kind of person that when hear microservices or caching or even Java, she immediately loses interest and stops listening.
