# quality attributes

- that define the applications capabilities.

- Almost all those quality attributes are the name that ends with -ilitie.

- Quality attribute is an attribute of the system that describes a specific capability that is not related to a specific functional requirement.

- Quality attributes are closely tied to non-functional requirements and they describe what technical capabilities should be used in order to fulfill the non-functional requirement.

  - For example, let's say we have the following non-functional requirement. The system must work under heavy load, but should not waste money on unused resources. This is one of the most common non-functional requirement, even if not defined with this exact wording. In order to make it work we will have to implement the scalability quality attribute. 

- So safe to say that the system must have the scalability quality attribute. Once the quality attributes are set, the architecture must take them into account and make sure they are implemented.


- Non-functional requirements define what the system should deal with. Quality attributes map those requirements to technical capabilities, and the architecture describes how those capabilities will be designed and implemented.

- The various Quality Attributes map to the Non-Functional Requirements and are implemented in the architecture.
